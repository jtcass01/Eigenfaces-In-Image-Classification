  <h3 align="center">A Study On The Efficacy of Using Eigenfaces In Image Classification</h3>

  <p align="center">
    The increased use of image classification in technology today has incited a rise in research and development for new approaches in facial detection and identification models. 
    Two common problems in image classification are storing large datasets and model training costs.
    One approach to achieving dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance is Principal Component Analysis where a subset of eigenvectors, also known in the domain of facial detection as ``eigenfaces'', are used to represent the data in a lower dimensionality space.
    This paper presents an image classification model based on eigenfaces and support vector machines using the Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES) dataset. 
    Implementation of an image classification model is described, and performance analysis of the model is presented with a focus on the efficacy of using eigenfaces when training the model.
